- What is Redux ? 
    > Redux is a predictable state container for javascript apps.

- It is for javascript apps
    > Redux is not tightly coupled with react
    > It can be use with react, angular, vue and vanilla javascript
    > It is library for javascript apps

- It is a state container
    > It stores and manages the state of an application

- It is predictable
    > predictable means all state transitions are explicit and it is possible to keep track of them
    > i.e changes to the application's state becomes predictable 

- Why Redux ? 
    > In Redux, State contain outside of the component hence available to all the components
    > So we will not need to lift the state in parent component and pass state to other child components(prop drilling)
    
- Alternate to Redux
    > React context - prevents prop drilling
    > useContext + useReducer

- What is React-Redux ? 
    > library for binding redux to react
